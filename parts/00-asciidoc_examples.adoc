== AsciiDoc Syntax Examples

*AsciiDoc* sits right in between Markdown and LatTeX:

* it is human-readable, like Markdown;
* it can be rendered on GitHub, like Markdown;
* it is more versatile than (vanilla) Markdown and is still simpler (but less powerful) than LaTeX;
* it is more PDF-aware than Markdown, e.g., with article and book document types.

For such reasons, AsciiDoc is a great language for technical writing. It works well for books (see the https://github.com/progit/progit2[Pro Git] book), and is great for project documentation (see the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework[Spring framework] repository).

TIP: It should be also great to write your architecture document!

So, here is a quick guide for some handy basic syntax. However, if this is not enough the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[official AsciiDoc documentation] offers much more!

=== Section

==== Subsection

===== Subsubsection

=== Text Decoration

This is a paragraph, with *bold text*, _italicized text_, `monospaced text`, and even #highlighted text#.

=== Lists

Bullets

* Item 1
* Item 2

Numbered

. Item 1
. Item 2

Definition

[horizontal]
Term 1:: Definition 1
Term 2:: Definition 2

=== Quoting

[quote, Author, Source]
____
This is a quote.
____

=== Admonitions

NOTE: This is a note.

WARNING: This is a warning.


=== Code Blocks

[source,python]
----
print("Hello, World!")
----

=== Tables

.This is the table caption
[#tab-label]
|===
| Header 1 | Header 2
| Cell 1-1 | Cell 1-2
| Cell 2-1 | Cell 2-2
|===

=== Images

The root path to all images (even from within section file) is defined in the All images 

.This is the figure caption
[#img-label]
image::example_image.png[alt text,200]

=== Links, References, Bibliography and Footnotes

*Cross-referencing* looks like this:

* for sections - xref:_system_context[].
* for tables and figures - xref:tab-label[], xref:img-label[]

Create *external links* (e.g., URLs) with an autolink (http://example.com) or a http://example.com[text replacement].

*Bibliography* must be defined in a separate file (`references.adoc`). Once defined, you cite them like this <<smith23>>. For the numbering to work, make sure to give both label and number:

----
- [[[smith23,1]]] Smith, John....
----

*Footnotes* can be done lie this.footnote:[This is the footnote.] But there is a limitation for PDFs, they currently only appear as endnotes (i.e., together with the bibliography). So you may want to avoid them and just create a bibliographic entry.

=== Comments

----
// This is a single-line comment.

////
This is a block comment.
